ðŸ›’ Amazon Homepage Clone  

This is a small project I built while learning **HTML and CSS**.  
I recreated the **Amazon homepage** to practice how layouts, navigation bars, and sections are structured.  

# What I practiced here:
- Writing clean HTML
- Using CSS for layout (Flexbox, positioning)
- Breaking down a big page into smaller components  

# Why this project?
I learn best by building, and picking a website I use every day made it fun.  
Even though this is just the homepage, it gave me confidence with the basics and showed me how much detail goes into real websites.  

# How to try it out:
- Clone this repo or download the files
- Open `index.html` in your browser  



ðŸ’¡ This is one of my first steps into **frontend development**. Next, Iâ€™m planning to add **JavaScript** and explore frameworks like **React**.
